This project was created first semester of Sophomore year in an applications programming course. It contains the backend for 
a very simple Civilization game. The point of the project was not to build an actual fun and functioning game but to put
principles of object oriented programming into practice. For example we used design patterns such as strategy pattern,
adapter pattern, decorator pattern, facade pattern, and builder pattern. While there were different iterations of the game,
a crucial aspect of the project was that after each iteration we could still play the old versions of the game even with the
new source code.
