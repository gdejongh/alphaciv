As part of their algorithm for making a board, the DeltaCiv programmers decided to use a .txt file to specify the layout of the terrain.

The board is layed out in grid of letters, where each letter sets the tile at that position in the grid to a certain type of terrain.

O = Ocean
P = Plain
T = Forest
H = Hill
M = Mountain
